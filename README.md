# Deep-Learning-Specialization
All code from this repository is for the programming assignments from the specialization in Deep Learning given by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?skipBrowseRedirect=true), and taught by Professor Andrew Yang.  The specialization consists of 5 courses:
- [x] Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning  
- [x] Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
- [x] Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects (no programming assignments)
- [x] Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks
- [ ] Course 5: Sequence Models
A final grade of 100% was achieved for the first four courses. The fifth course is yet to be completed.
